            <h1>Amun Temple <br> Enclosure</h1>
            <h5><a href="egypt.html">egypt</a></h5>
            <hr>
            <p>Amun-Ra was the local god of Karnak (Luxor) and during the New Kingdom,<br> when the princes of Thebes ruled Egypt, he became the preeminent state god, <br> with a temple that reflected his status. At the height of its power, the temple <br> owned 421,000 head of cattle, 65 cities, 83 ships and 276,400 hectares of <br> agricultural land and had 81,000 people working for it. The shell that remains, <br> sacked by Assyrians and Persians, is still one of the world's great archaeological <br> sites, grand, beautiful and inspiring.</p>
         
            <blockquote>The Quay of Amun was the dock where the large boats carrying the statues of the gods moored during <br> festivals. From paintings in the tomb of Nakht and elsewhere we know that there were palaces to the north <br> of the quay and that these were surrounded by lush gardens. On the east side, a ramp slopes down to the <br> processional avenue of ram-headed sphinxes. These lead to the massive unfinished first pylon, the last to <br> be built, during the reign of Nectanebo I (30th dynasty). The inner side of the pylon still has the massive <br> mud-brick construction ramp, up which blocks of stone for the pylon were dragged with rollers and ropes. <br> Napoleon’s expedition recorded blocks still on the ramp.
             <h5>Great Court</h5>
               <br> <br> Behind the first pylon lies the Great Court, the largest area of the Karnak complex. To the left is the Shrine <br> of Seti II, with three small chapels that held the sacred barques (boats) of Mut, Amun and Khonsu during the <br> lead-up to the Opet Festival. In the southeastern corner (far right) is the well-preserved Temple of Ramses <br> III, a miniature version of the pharaoh’s temple at Medinat Habu. The temple plan is simple and classic: <br> pylon, open court, vestibule with four Osirid columns and four columns, hypostyle hall with eight columns <br> and three barque chapels for Amun, Mut and Khonsu. At the centre of the court is a 21m column with a <br> papyrus-shaped capital – the only survivor of ten columns that originally stood here – and a small alabaster altar,<br> all that remainsof the Kiosk of Taharka, the 25
            <h5>Great Hypostyle Hall</h5>

            <br> <br> Beyond the second pylon is the extraordinary Great Hypostyle Hall, one of the greatest  <br> monuments ever built. Covering 5500 sq m – enough space to contain both Rome’s St Peter’s Basilica and <br> London’s St Paul’s Cathedral – the hall is an unforgettable forest of 134 towering stone pillars. Their papyrus <br>  shape symbolise a swamp, of which there were so many along the Nile. Ancient Egyptians believed that <br>  these plants surrounded the primeval mound on which life was first created. Each summer when the Nile <br> began to flood, this hall and its columns would  fill with several feet of water. Originally, the columns would <br> have  been brightly painted – some colour remains – and roofed, making it pretty dark away from the lit main <br> axis. The size and grandeur of the pillars and the endless decorations can be overwhelming, so take your <br> time, sit for a while and stare at the dizzying spectacle.
            <br> <br>The hall was planned by Ramses I and built by Seti I and Ramses II. Note the difference in quality between  <br>the delicate raised relief in the northern part, by Seti I, and the much cruder sunken relief work, added  by <br> Ramses II in the southern part of the hall. The cryptic scenes on the inner walls were intended for the <br>  priesthood and the royalty who understood the religious context, but the outer walls are easier to <br> comprehend, showing the pharaoh’s military prowess and strength, and his ability to bring order to chaos. <br> <br>
            On the back of the third pylon, built by Amenhotep III, to the right the pharaoh is shown sailing the sacred <br> barque during the Opet Festival. Tuthmosis I (1504–1492 BC) created a narrow court between the third and <br> fourth pylons, where four obelisks stood, two each for Tuthmosis I and Tuthmosis III (1479–1425 BC). Only <br> the bases remain except for one, 22m high, raised for Tuthmosis I.
         <h5>Inner Temple</h5>

         The ruined fifth pylon, constructed by Tuthmosis I, leads to another colonnade now badly ruined, followed <br> by the small sixth pylon, raised by Tuthmosis III, who also built the pair of red-granite columns in the <br> vestibule beyond, carved with the lotus and the papyrus, the symbols of Upper and Lower Egypt. Nearby, on <br> the left, are two huge statues of Amun and the goddess Amunet, carved in the reign of Tutankhamun.
         East of <br> the shrine of Philip Arrhidaeus is the oldest-known part of the temple, the Middle Kingdom Court, <br> where Sesostris I built a shrine, of which the foundation walls have been found. On the northern wall of the  <br> court is the Wall of Records, a running tally of the organised tribute the pharaoh exacted in honour of Amun <br> from his subjugated lands.

         <h5>Secondary Axis of the Amun Temple Enclosure</h5>
        </div>

        The courtyard between the Hypostyle Hall and the seventh pylon, built by Tuthmosis III, is known as the <br> cachette court, as thousands of stone and bronze statues were discovered here in 1903. The priests had <br> the  old statues and temple furniture they no longer needed buried around 300 BC. Most statues were sent <br> to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, but some remain, standing in front of the seventh pylon, including four of  <br>Tuthmosis III on the left.
        <br> <br> The well-preserved eighth pylon, built by Queen Hatshepsut, is the oldest part of the north–south axis of <br> the temple, and one of the earliest pylons in Karnak. Carved on it is a text she falsely attributed to Tuthmosis <br> I, justifying her taking the throne of Egypt.

        <br> <br>East of the seventh and eighth pylons is the sacred lake, where, according to Herodotus, the priests of <br> Amun bathed twice daily and nightly for ritual purity. On the northwestern side of the lake is part of the <br> Fallen Obelisk of Hatshepsut showing her coronation, and a giant scarab in stone dedicated by Amenhotep <br> III to Khepri, a form of the sun god.
        <br> <br>In the southwestern corner of the enclosure is the Temple of Khonsu, god of the moon, and son of Amun <br> and Mut. It can be reached from a door in the southern wall of the Hypostyle Hall of the Temple of Amun, via <br> a path through various blocks of stone. The temple, mostly the work of Ramses III and enlarged by later <br> Ramesside rulers, lies north of Euergetes’ Gate and the avenue of sphinxes leading to Luxor Temple. <br> The temple pylon leads via a peristyle court to a hypostyle hall with eight columns carved with figures of <br> Ramses XI and the High Priest Herihor, who effectively ruled Upper Egypt at the time. The next chamber <br> housed the sacred barque of Khonsu.
